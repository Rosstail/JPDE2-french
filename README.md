This is a repository to help keeping track of the JPDE2 french translation project from @meinoskaen.

The rules are:
- Never push into Master branch.
  - Instead, you should create a new branch depending on the file you are working on.
  - Once the work done, push into your branch then create a pull request from your branch to Master.
  - At least 2 people must validate your request.
