This is a repository to help keeping track of the JPDE2 french translation project from @meinoskaen.

The rules are:
- Never push into Master branch.
  - Instead, you should create a new branch depending on the file you are working on.
  - Once the work done, push into your branch then create a pull request from your branch to Master.
  - At least 1 people must validate your request.
- Some things can lead to confusion upon translation. Witch words and terms must be translated and in general, french tends to give a genre to some words.
  - "Hunters" and "Huntresses" are translated as "Chasseurs" and "Chasseresses"
  - "Team" is transated as "Équipe"
  - "Dust" is gendered as masculine -> "Le Dust", "Du dust"
  - "Semblance" must be decided.
  - "Faunus" stay the same word in single. "Le peuple faunus", "Un/Une faunus". Le pluriel reste à décider.
