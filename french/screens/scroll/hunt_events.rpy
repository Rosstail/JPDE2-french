    old "The event now known as the Fall of Beacon was a watershed moment for the world. It shattered alliances, convictions, assumptions and the very bedrock of civilization on Remnant. Never before had Hunters and students been so targeted, not even during the Great War: for all the conflicts and disputes in history, the unspoken rule had always been to respect the independence and life of Hunters. Their mission served the greater good and benefited everyone, no matter the nation or race."

    old "Anti-faunus sentiments are at an all time high in Vale and Atlas both, and Menagerie has been forced to involve itself in international politics for the first time since its founding. Vacuo has similarly started taking a more pro-active stance in reaction to Atlas's increased international interventionism. Most surprising of all, though, was the development concerning the Beacon students and valesian Hunters who refused to be rolled into the new Atlas-ran structure. Taking possession of an once unclaimed piece of no-man's land in the Kingdom of Vale, they've founded a new nation, whose very existence is now already being called into question..."
