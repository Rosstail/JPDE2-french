    old "The Fortress of Red Cliffs is an ancient fortification built and held by the vacuosi army at a time when Vacuo was battling for territory with their neighbor, the Kingdom of Vale. The peaks stand in a strategic location, overlooking the pass where Vacuo's cold desert slowly gives way to Vale's grasslands, an ancient and important trade route."

    old "The location was eventually abandoned by Vacuo when the essential water source of the Red Cliffs suddenly dried up. In the modern age, the location was overtaken by the White Fang, as it was discovered that the particular chemical composition of the rocks of Red Cliffs cause interferences in a number of advanced instruments."

    old "The White Fang were recently forced to leave the fortification as the Fall of Beacon brought increased attention on White Fang activities Remnant-wide, including in Vacuo. Still, its familiarity and isolation lead to it being chosen as the meeting spot between White Fang Supreme Leader Sienna Khan and her treasonous subordinate, Adam Taurus."

    old "The city of Peak started as a territory donated to the would-be settlers by the once royal family of the Kingdom of Vale. A thriving mining settlement with deep veins of pyrobsidian, it one day suddenly went silent. Upon investigation, anyone stepping past the outer walls would be affected by sudden bouts of acute letargy. Subsequently, the city was sealed and declared No Man's Land."

    old "A decade after the sealing of the city, its mysteries were unravelled and its field broken by a group of students from the Hunter Academy of Beacon. While the details have so far been kept secret, the incident and consequent demise of its population were attributed to the machinations of one of its residents: Beacon alumnus Weser van Goethe. The man is currently wanted, his location unknown."

    old "Following the Fall of Beacon the re-opened city was claimed by the diaspora of Beacon Academy and the Valesian Chapter of the Hunter Organizations, refusing to bend the knee to the new Atlesian administration. If at first an eyesore in the eyes of the Vale Council, rethoric softened when Peak offered to start taking in war refugees from Mistral: in exchange, Peak was recognized as a city in the Kingdom of Vale."

    old "Two years and a half into its existence, the Vale Council would come to regret its decision as the city started to also attract Valesian citizens hostile to the growing influence of Atlas: in particular, farmers. The last straw would come on the 1st of Attia, 492: historically the day when the Valesian Royal Family abdicated following the Great War, Peak announced its intention to secede from the Kingdom of Vale, forming the Royal Duchy of Peak under the leadership of Duchess Glynda Goodwitch the I."

    old "At the height of the first wave of organizations and movements for the rights of the Fauni people, a conference was held where a solution was touted: relocating all Fauni people to the Island of Menagerie, off the south coast of Mistral. Solution which, to the Fauni leaders, felt more like an insult as most of the island was covered by an inhabitable hot desert, and it was populated by rare and dangerous species of Grimm. Still, they would take it."

    old "While the thinly veiled segregation plan failed, as there are still ever-increasing numbers of Fauni all over Remnant, no one would deny that they have turned the island -or at least the habitable parts on the northern coastline- into their homeland. With masterful diplomacy, Menagerie has been thriving through the decades, to the point of almost running out of space for new constructions."

    old "In recent times these constraints, the shifting international situation and the actions of the White Fang have caused the leaders of the nation, the Belladonnas, to start reconsidering many of their policies, up to and including their historical neutrality. The security conference during which they will be hosting high level representatives from all of Remnant's nations, sans Mistral, shall be the proving ground for this change."
