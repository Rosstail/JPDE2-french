    old "The largest and most prominent international organization for the rights of fauni, the White Fang started out of a desire to coordinate at an international level all the smaller regional organizations and pool together their resources and intelligence. In their first form, under the guidance of Ghira and Kali Belladonna, the organization was mainly involved in non-violent protesting, lobbying, campaigning and political influencing. Through their original methods they won many battles, but they soon found a cunning and ruthless adversary in the Schnee Company."

    old "Tensions grew as the second generation in the company's leadership used their increasing wealth and influence to push for legislations which favoured the company and its executives while diminishing the rights of workers, particularly in sectors where the workforce was disproportionally made up of Fauni. Escalating tensions came to a head during the events of White Monday, where the peaceful protesters ultimately turned violent. Riding on that wave of growing resentment and the ultimate repeal of the hated legislation, the Belladonnas abdicated their position."

    old "The second generation leader of the Fang, Sienna Khan, brought upon a number of organizational reforms and increased the scope of activities of the Fang, forming an ever increasing militaristic branch which according to some may now be the second biggest army in Remnant. Protests and lobbying were joined by raids and bombings, and together they slowly started chipping away at the power and influence of the Schnee Company while also giving rise to an extremist fringe within the ranks of the Fang."

    old "It's from this extremist fringe that arose Adam Taurus, the Butcher of Beacon. Riding on the clout and influence accrued through the Fall of Beacon, he ultimately completed a violent takeover of the Fang with an attempted assassination of Sienna Khan. Through his take-over, he also rang the death toll on the history of the Fang, planning to turn it into a new organization with new goals and methods beholden to his vision: the Red Fang."

    old "As long as Grimm exist, so shall the Hunters. The role of someone trained in Aura and the use of their Semblance, tasked specifically with destroying Grimm and protecting humans and fauni from them, has existed as long as recorded history. The modern conception of the role is more recent, based on the structure of the Hunter Caste of Vacuo and the wealth of knowledge codified by Dorothea Grimm."

    old "Following the Great War, the Hunters formed into an international organization with the task of fighting and containing the Grimm, plus nurture and raise the next generation of Hunters through academies of various level. If on principle separate and independent from Remnant's nations, the reality varies with the regional chapter. For example, in the more militarized Atlas the Hunter Chapter has high levels of integration with the army."

    old "The Fall of Beacon has brought major changes in the Valesian chapter, which ended up under Atlas's jurisdiction after the event. Not all Valesian Hunters were willing to acquiesce, including most of the staff of Beacon Academy. This resulted in a schism, further exacerbated by the recent declaration of independence by the City of Peak, established and founded by the Hunter diaspora which constitutes the backbone of its ruling class."

    old "Grimm don't 'grow' in the traditional sense of the term. They don't weaken with age, their physical shape doesn't change for their entire life -barring damage- and none of their skills or abilities get stronger with time or usage, unless they survive long enough to suddenly change into a new form. This process seems to be completely dependent on the passage of time and also brings with it a change in behaviour."

    old "The Grimm are divided in three Weight Classes -so called because of the debunked belief that Growth automatically netted an increase in size-: Normal, Great -also called Alphas- and Gargantuan. Needless to say, an increased weight class also means increased danger. If most Hunters can handle a Normal Grimm or even groups of them on their own, Great Grimm require more effort and careful strategy to take down. With careful planning and the right equipment, though, even groups of humans not trained in using Aura can take down a an Alpha."

    old "Gargantuan Grimm instead require the combined effort and full might of multiple Hunters to be destroyed and their dangerousness varies wildly, depending on their abilities and the skills of those who would fell them. There have been Gargantuan Grimm taken out by just one team of four and others that have required the sacrifice of a dozen full fledged hunters to take down. Due to their territorial nature, though, they are much more manageable once identified and are usually left alone unless they directly endanger human settlements."

    old "The Fall of Beacon provided the first ever recorded appearance of a new class, the so called Primordial Grimm. Believed to be the progenitors, the first Grimm ever created, their sole role seems to be to stay hidden and keep recreating Grimm from wild Dark Matter, unless roused. Enviromental readings have then revealed that the Vale Area has seen a decrease in Grimm presence since the destruction of the local Primordial, code-name Kevin."
